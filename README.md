#        Trends on Phillips Morris International's Sprinklr Usage

This is a project conducted by self to identify PMI's usage of Sprinklr and ServiceNow.
We use SN as a means to support client's usage of applications.

As a lead for L2 team for Sprinklr which PMI uses as a chatting platform with their custtomer service, as well as reporting KPIs, the Jupyter notebooks here show trends on types of issues raised by PMI, types of requests as well as trending topics and incident openers by year.

Data included is from 2020 till June 2025. Since we have two categories of tickets raised - requests and incidents, hence for each category a separate notebook uploaded, and for each level of team (L2/L3).
