#        Trends on Phillips Morris International's Sprinklr Usage

This is a project conducted by self to identify Philip Morris International's usage of Sprinklr and ServiceNow.
We use ServiceNow as a means to support client's usage of applications and to modify configuration as requested by client, or fix issues as reported.

As a lead for L2 team for Sprinklr which PMI uses as a CXM platform with their customer base, these Jupyter notebooks show trends on types of issues raised by PMI, types of requests as well as trending topics for both categories of tickets; this also includes specific users from PMI who raised the most number of requests/incidents for each year. Also included is text analysis on the descriptions each ticket includes, suggesting on the types of issues raised by client providing visibility over how operations need to be conducted (operational strategy).

Data included is from 2020 till June 2025. Since we have two categories of tickets raised - requests and incidents, hence for each category a separate notebook uploaded, and for each level of team (L2/L3).

Thank you for going through the mining report.
